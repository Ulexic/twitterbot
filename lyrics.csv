When I want to feed;But I don't know why;When I want to feel;I'm not talking;Or corner cropping;Send pound for pound;I'll use my know-how
Got a list of lips;Twisted tongues and tips;Fancier than church;Instead, install;Cold hands, hot heart;Burning black cloud;I'll use my know-how
Laura and Marty went to a party;And they hard-lined;I've no intention;Not to mention;That you hard-lined
So you've lost your touch;Limp and losing sleep;If you don't have fun;Crowd turned panic;Destroyed, damaged;Born to a ghost town;I'll use my know-how
I might lift the curse and;Fight you all the time;I might pinch the ends and;Throw you back in line;It's easy and generic;So I can mute the beat;And the only one left in;Is gonna be me
'cause I don't mind it;Yea, I don't mind it;I don't mind it;Yea, I don't mind it
I don't wanna miss you;It's tight I can't unwind;I'll be blown to bits but;I don't really want to die;And you do me great service;When you call my bluff;I'll stay home for hours;But it's just never enough
I might beg your pardon;When the road is rude;And I might count the hours;And bend the wire to tune;Dissect drawing circles;Or spinning in my seat;When the coach is yelling;Running through the streets
Who will you meet the morning of;You change skins you sleep and call your baby;Who will you meet when you're in love;A fish, a catch, a friend to show
Cuz i can cut the cord with you any day;I don't need you to remind me who's the boss of me;Cuz i could be the boss of you any day;I tried really hard
When you pray your hands go wrong;When you kneel you sink and rupture reason;And when the bandages fall off;We are inside out again
It's consequence, meaningless;Brazen, tried and true;A legacy of heresy;Of what bad men can do
I hope you don't fear how far the fall;I hope you don't fear who you call
I hope you don't fear what you can't control;I hope you don't fear who you hold
I am not facing the wrecking ball;I am not facing the wrecking ball;I am not facing the wrecking ball
This is the same dark place for martyrs;Where everyone just wants a piece;And it's for richer or poorer, all breaking bars;We all want the same disease;
Madness in the modern jungle;Keeping thirst for when we feast;And on the crescent moon, clocked in at noon;And everyone can take a seat
You say you won't fall, he loves you more;You taste the poison arrow, the poison arrow;The poison arrow, the poison arrow
My mind's double vision;A stinging sensation;A fringe on the heel of disease
A mystery maker;For givers, not takers;I'll take what I want when I please
Everyone's in;We are ripe for a killing;Just follow me into the sun
Systemic and reason;Syringe in the basin;Toxic and making me numb
Pleasure comes with sleep;A deep night to retreat;The daytime is a punishment
Bend your head forward;You got what you deserve;Stop acting entirely stunned
Green vapors follow me;Green vapors follow me
I'm not gonna admit you're scary;If I jump it's involuntary;Vapors creeping, I'm not sleeping;All night
Get out from underneath our bed;Get out from up inside my head;Vapors creeping, I'm not sleeping;All night
You spit a spotted mile;Turn around in the bed and then said to me;"I'm tired, please make it true";"And do what I, what I have asked of you"
How much will tide me over?;Titan of love and shame;It's time we all embrace the blame
Hissing cars, the spit beneath the salt stars, thin moon;Generous highways that lead me back towards you;When I pass your house the light is on in your room;Drag my feet beyond the block, I am behind you
How much will tide me over?;Titan of love and shame
I follow you to a deep black lake;I put my foot in your shoe;And I'll sweat it out in the grieving stage;I'll make a meal for you
Swallow the saints while you spike the punch;And obey the master's rules;We kiss his ring while the fat lady sings;A song just for you
Same day, sick bed;Hole in my head
Crushing the kingdom, burning the wheel;Pour blood on the strawman, making him real
My confusion left a stain;Stripped the entire script;And changed all the names
I'm laid down, left you waiting;Took me under your arm;A vision sworn;A friend to mourn;It never runs you raw
If I burn the house down, could I stay?;Would you keep me anyway?;If I owed you cash, but couldn't pay;Would you keep me anyway?
If your car spun out while I was at the wheel;Would you keep me anyway?;If I broke both knees while I tried to kneel;Would you keep me anyway?
Would you keep me anyway?;Though I keep myself so low;Would you keep me anyway?;Though I keep myself so low;I keep myself so low
The choice was not mine, disconnect;How soon can I try to forget?;The choice was not mine, disconnect
Why won't you trust me through the bad situations?;I can't remember when;We got along as friends;Perch on my back, I'm in a bad situation;Falling onto my knees;The pyre in front of me
White, a fossil erupts;You fooled me
I know the mess I've made;Admit that I'm afraid;You'll never let me into your heart
Your reflex postulates a bad situation;It doesn't have to be;One more catastrophe;Blood on the road, I'm bound for annihilation;Maybe you laugh at me;Continue trapping me
White, a fossil erupts;You fooled me
I know the mess I've made;Admit that I'm afraid;You'll never let me into your heart
Dig through my bag of bones;No one can take you home but me;Dig through my bag of bones;No one can take you home but me
You smoked beside the stage;With the can in your hand, you then said to me;"I'm tired, please make it true";"And do what I, what I have asked of you"
I'll keep you;My fashion friend;You're upside-down;With arrogance;You touch your toes;And stick your nose in the air
Eye to eye;What you wanna see;Eye to eye;Make you proud of me
I wouldn't be surprised;If no one wants to waste their time with me;I'm joyfully employed;I'm Normal;I wouldn't be surprised;If no one wants to waste their time with me;I'm joyfully employed;I'm Normal
Mister hands my new attire;You bury my rings and make me dig;I am disgraced and got no soul;When you're around
If I invite you over;Can you look me in the eye;Because your head is a cavern;And I wanna crawl inside;I put some speakers in your ears;And I stuff up where you speak;You gotta whole lotta nerve;To think that you can fool me
'Cause there's a new kid on my street;And he's called the new elite
Let me shovel out your brains;Hang my image in your skull;So I can be the vision;In your nightmares from now on;You put me in my place;And I gotta be real mean;You gotta whole lotta nerve;To think that you can fool me
There's a new kinda high;When they find a pill to try;And you can coax me politely;But I'm not gonna lie;I need a brief inspection;And a judge up on the seat;You gotta whole lotta nerve;To think that you can fool me
If you hold me to my word;Then I will never speak;'Cause I'm forgotten;I've forgot;Everything I need;I pass the boss the phone;But who's on to receive;It's a loss;I can't decide;Which cold call I need
I want you;To fall asleep;And die with me;The level gets too deep;And it dies with me
I have secret eyes;That glue me to my seat;'Cause I'm forgotten;I've forgot;Exactly what I need;It's classic if it's kitsch;I'm nude as I was born;But I'm at loss;I can't decide;Which hat should be worn
You stammer on your crutch;'Cause no one likes you much;You skunk the town;And who's around;To place you in the bunch;I'm nesting in a void;And living in a hole;It can't be said;I'll burn the bed;To warm you in the cold
I realize in record time;I know I can't change;You've bent my blood;And that's enough;I know I can't change
But that's why;I need you to know;It's wild and cured
I still hear you;Up in my room;You echo up the stairs;You claw the door;And leave a mark;And then you're not there
But that's why;I need you to know;I'm trying;It's wild but they found a cure
Hold your hand;On my head;You can watch me hold the bed;And I'll pretend to be asleep;You may claim me your gold;But I'm not yours to have or hold;You take all that's left of me
In a plume of smoke;A family ghost;Shows me all her teeth;The brightest white;Like heaven's light;Planting all its seeds
I've been walking backwards;Listening to your word of mouth;Your secret's wide open;And mine has slithered out
Excess, you sit sideways;And you dance a crooked dance;Excess, you are evil;Dressed for church and holding hands
I wanna be your late-night crisis line;I wanna give you all a piece of mind;I wanna be your late-night crisis line;I wanna give you all a piece of mind
I will be there Saturday night;Sucking up the trails of white light;I haunt you;Miss you like a snake in the grass;Four sore winters have passed;I'll haunt you
You'd count sheep with anyone;Anyone would do;You'd count sheep with anyone;Anyone would do
I will be the corner and cast;Meant for men, I'm loaded with plans;I'm cleaning clocks and hustling for time;I'm Ivy League, I know that you're mine
Take on your new jaw for challenge;Grit teeth in your sleep;Powder pile by your pillow;Dusting all your dreams
But it's not like I planned;The teeth don't make the man;And he locks where I sit;He sinks into my wrist
Better living with some new chops;Three square meals a day;He can't hold down this new job;He blows his bonus pay
'Cause it's not like I planned;The teeth don't make the man;And he locks where I sit;He sinks into my wrist
I took a back road with this guy;I needed you so I could hide;'Cause what they said was something I could not repeat
They went dancing, oh;It was planned and I -;I was thrust to my worst nightmare
This is it;It's the last time;Please is this it;It's the last time;You set me up
They were midnight rats;Racing cabs for cash;You are young and not meant for that scene
I got a feeling you're all wrong;You gave us all the slip;'Cause I got this feeling you're all wrong;I'm begging you;Loosen up your grip
Statements are nameless;It's romance;By means, I do not need this;This is the last time;I mean it;Whoa
I, I have flown us to the moon;With a wire I spun from you
Smashed the door on my spirit house;Pinned my button onto your blouse
I'm living in a brass bell and;It's too loud, it's too loud
All your dreams are becoming true;Just like you wanted them to;Pin my mask, bind me still;Pour my blood, feed me pills;Ball your fist, cut my lung;Hold me close with your gun
When you trap animals inside, it's no wonder;Perfect my isolation, hide;So no one can hurt me now
Error, I relapsed;Blood on the road;I'll get high till I explode
You still exist, I'm in the ditch;There's no other;Now it's my turn and I'm reborn;So no one can hurt me now
When I heard last night;I pitched a fit;The filthy water rushing in
Forget my name;I'm a freight train in the desert dragging chains
Breathe in the miles, smell the wind;Feel the thunder;Mechanics seized, now I'm reborn;So no one can hurt me now
I know this feeling;Tied to the road;I'll get high till I explode
You fought and won;Melt in the big decay;Devour me whole;Regret me to this day
So I let you go;I let you go;So I let you go
I call you near;So you won't doubt;Show her she's not;Going to go without
If I could explain it;How black turns to blue;Now the stage is empty;And I am too
I played my worst;Threw in a fixed game;You held me close;Promised the cure for pain
If I could explain it;How black turns to blue;Now the stage is empty;And I am too
A titan swells from cobblestone;I fear his form, his hollow moan;If he sees me slip, he might judge me;Small as I am, I go to sleep
If you are a brick, then I am a bone;And if you surround me, I'll build you a home;I swing with the rest, a blistering bomb;And when you surround me I became undone
My one desire is in your breast;Upon the shelves, your narrow chest;Beyond the void there is a screen;Voices I don't know speak for me
If you are a brick, then I am a bone;And if you surround me, I'll build you a home;I swing with the rest, a blistering bomb;And when you surround me, I became undone
In conflict, who is dangerous?;The elite right in front;In conflict, who is dangerous?;Burnt tapestry in front of me
When you leave me I will watch the mourning dove;If you don't need me then I took it far enough
With a child's gaze I'll have so much to confess;Repeat your pulse till your heart beats out of your chest;I'm chained;I'm lost in your elegance
I can't lie 'cause now my;Love for you is too strong to hide;Drink from the fountain until it's dry
An ugly fit, a gutted song, what you require;You taught me well, reach through the mirror, I am the liar;I'm chained;I'm lost in your melody
I can't lie 'cause now my;Love for you is too strong to hide;Drink from the fountain till it's dry;Dry
I was willing, you liked me best;When I was invisible
I was willing, you liked me best;You liked me best;When I was invisible
I was willing, you liked me best;You liked me best
When you leave me I will watch the mourning dove;If you don't need me then I took it far enough;If you don't need me then I took it far enough;If you don't need me then I took it far enough;I'm chained;I'm lost in your elegance
I can't lie 'cause now my;Love for you is too strong to hide;I can't lie 'cause now my;Love for you is too strong to hide;Drink from the fountain till it's dry;Dry
You should not have had expectations;Think of all the violence you bring;Take a look, it is all around you;Clumps of hair and broken strings
Stand in front of the bright light;Beaming, it shines right through
Armed with iron, tipping the brass;It was written on his face, it hit me
I don't really care;When it's all said and done;I'm withered in despair;A burnt pile in the sun
And now it's time to take a dip with everyone else;Arms wide open, drink up and say;No one's safe, the state will surround you;When they come, here's what they'll say
Trust in the dream, don't deny;Time says it can be yours
In their minds there are no illusions;Don't care if you die;An ounce of blood won't fill the bucket;Where we get baptized;The beat of sin and trials of earth;Where everybody dies;In this simulation, going down;On fire
I don't really care;When it's all said and done;I'm withered in despair;A burnt pile, a burnt pile in the sun
Lights flash and I spoke too soon;A vision sparks when you speak;I cannot feel, I can't see;It must be 'cause I hated you;Drive your blade into me;Hollow out the entry
Now I got what I want;It won't make me feel better;Now I got what I want;It won't me feel better;Built brick by brick in hell
I want it all;An ornament;Your head hangs heavy on it;I want it all;An ornament;Your head hangs heavy on it
Can I stay?;Promise not to cry;You are in charge, take a stand;Hold me down 'cause you can;I feel angry;I'm confused;All my poor breeding seeping through
An ornament;Your head hangs heavy on it;An ornament;Your head hangs heavy on it;An ornament;Your head hangs heavy on it;An ornament;Your head hangs heavy on it
You went and put salt in my drink;Now I'm cross, you've got nothing to say;You give me the gun and I think I'm a mess;And I need you to stay
Why must I be the angry one;I won't cry, fine line between our love;I can't speak but you ask;What have I done?
Set aside from this ring system cover me in dust;Where magic lies with a fool's wisdom just below the crust;I fashion you to lay your soul a mystic death was said;To bring the songs of cherubim;Into your empty head
And if our rapport is so sour;You're a big bank and I.O.U;I'll take your silence as a sign;You're a big shot but who needs who?
I dressed up the horses, set them loose;Sunk the needle deep and took in every drop;A violent path, an inch in time;An error, my device the anchor drops
Miles of horses gallop to the edge;I saw murder in their mouths we try the whip;Powerful, more muscle and stiff lip;The reins are chains and I have lost my grip
Try with all my heart I choke, I'm ready to go;And if you're through with me then please say so
I said peel the skin raw;Pinch 'til the feeling's gone
I built this game to play and to pretend;You are a dark machine and I'm a cog;When engines crack, when fuel lines break off;I'll save your bits and let your motor rot
I'm still home when the telephone rings;I'm impartial and a martyr;It's quite clear wearing all of my rings;I'm less than feed or fodder
If you want I'll do it;But I'm so ill-equipped;I'm a knot in the stitch;Try the last call and dream;On the next try I'll be much sweeter;Yeah, in the next life I'll be better
I toss dimes in the wishing well;And I'm broke cause you took all of me;My tombstone on a grassy hill;It's a matter of fact, all my change goes to hell
Dig deep find the villain inside;The one you dare not speak of;Find peace at the end of the line;The dial tone is your true love
Yeah, in the next life I'll be better
I toss dimes in the wishing well;It's a matter of fact, all my change goes to hell
I'll put the nickel, in you;Draw my blood deep in the syringe;White lines capture my insides;Big and brass, girl or a boy
Load me with lead, one million degrees;I'm hot, a burning car;With each flower, I'll plant the dreams in;My dry mind
There are ways to fix a broken sound;With my head in the sky, my ear to the ground;Ways to fix a broken sound;With my head in the sky, my ear to the ground
I'll twist my neck in, the tight noose;While the night grows wide and dark;Squeeze through the tube, and don't move;Your swollen mind and heavy heart
Keep me honest;And I won't tell them;Make me promise;Oh, oh oh oh, oh;Empty room, so narrow;Suck marrow from your bones;Reach far across the room;And leave me all alone
I trained a bird to play;Painful, it perched on my left hand;Torn by your stinging gaze;Light-years engulfed in your pain;I have sworn you're one of them;And I'm a stain on your report;I have sworn you're one of them;A last resort
I play trick or treat in the hospital halls;Pink and pastel blue, I'm bouncing off the walls;I'd like to calculate every swollen bone;But I'm strapped inside myself countless hours alone
It's blind men, diseased;Pills and scripts, they push me
Towards, telephones, call anyone with hope;Of sculpting life as it was;They strip to check my broken neck, I'm doped;Do they think it's a trick;That I pull when I'm sick
But I swear to you, it's true;Yes I swear to you, it's true;Yes I swear to you, it's true;Yes I swear to you, it's true
Swim through the afterbirth, while giant veins offend;I'm stretching the skin, 'til it splits;They strip to check my broken neck, I'm doped;Desert flower, golden hour, stepping in, pools of blood
Put your hand;On my chest;Hold your breath;Broken neck;But I swear to you;It's true
I want some kind of miracle;To split, separate;The addict and the parasite;My abstract creates;And I know you will appreciate me in any way;But the pathosis it strips my bones;Just for the holidays
Please won't you bury me on Rose Mountain;I'm so small;I'll be in peace on Rose Mountain
White lines slice the dark highway;I'm shattered on the sleigh
I'm nothing like the others;My grave is deep;I'm walking on the moon;I'm nothing like the others;I was made just for you
Please won't you bury me on Rose Mountain;Speak of my legacy on Rose Mountain
While I'm in the rush of seasons;Rose withered flat and dry;No rational no reason;So I won't try
Don't count on me again;I obsess on our encounters;I want us to be friends;I'm not hopeless, helpless, or begging you to stay;It's just turning out that way
I mapped out your lie and you aren't good for me;But I'll follow all your orders and you can have all of me;While I sit back and think of how I used to be;There ain't nothing left to do but dream
What if all these fantasies come rushing in at night?;But it's just too far for the ancients to allow;And I'm trapped at home just waiting for you to call;I know it's over now
Even when it's poison;I'll fix you and have my fill;With potion so heavily swilled;And a hand full of hate;Sinners lose lock the gate;Stir the slop burn your wrist now you lose;
I twisted the volume too loud;I touched the screen and turned around;I'm assigned and I'm bound and now I lose
Our triumph is sleeping now;My form of devotion;I'll drag you down in the crowd;I go through the motions
Even when it's poison;I'm left with your precious tools;It's stained too explicit to miss;Well letters fall;At my feet;Victory, a mother's grief;Nothing comes and nothing grows and now you lose;
I am late, I am lost;Scraping pain off the cross;Grab the wheel and make me steer and now I lose
Your system stops;Set back the clocks;I climbed above it, how about you?;Dissect my words;See how they hurt;I climbed above it, how about you?;
I want to win;Please let me in;You see me curled up by the gate;I stretch to meet uneven beats;They test my tempo, how about you?;
I know it's real;I want to feel;All of the things I've been refused;And celebrate my first victory;Destroy my history with you
White dress is your tipping point;Let our whispers pass anywhere they want to go;I'm resting in your rocking chair;I can hear you scream anywhere you want to go
I'm pinned to the open road with a love so deep that I can't bear;Black fence 'round the skin I can't sleep in;I'm pinching the nerve it's not fair
I like time staring at white lines;Will I miss my chance to go anywhere I wanna go?;The dead grass rivers slipping past;Will I miss my chance to go anywhere I wanna go?
I'll be your fiction and flight;I'll be your fight with denial;Criminal image of you
You're a scepter in the dark;Brought tyranny to my heart;Criminal image of you
I draw your blood, steeped in sin;Drag a needle on your skin;Your hands have got me unglued
Can measure pause when we speak;You spin the spell, and I'm weak;Criminal image of you
You're a siren, anything I want;Everything I want;You're a siren, anything I want;Everything I want
I'll take my penance with years;Gathering cups of your tears;Searing myself with their heat
Chained to your curse and sickness;When I taste blood in your kiss;The tiger trap holding me
Lashed out, no purpose, just pain;Three thousand miles away;Criminal image of you
White knuckle you made it stop;Your heart is hard as a rock;Criminal image of you
I have been so small in my head;I'm a hole in your thoughts;I have been so small in my head;But you've got me caught
Initial on every pill;The chemicals keep me still;Bursting synapse in a fugue;Drawing your picture at most;The only way I get close;Standing way back in the queue
Crimson red paint on my door;You've skipped over me before;Criminal image of you;And I am bound in your sleep;Prisoner to all your dreams;Criminal image of you
When you rust red like blood I wonder;Whose house is this? A spell I'm under;Who's wrapped in bed and sweetly sleeping?;I carve my name into the ceiling
You'll always control me;You'll always control;You'll always control me;You'll always have control
Take my madness beneath your heel;Even if it begs
Painting myself in all four corners;Near the furthest room from the front door;Whose house is this? A gift was promised;Future structures till we all vanish
My life in this glass house;Impossible to get out
All the men before me swollen with sin;Scraped the earth nude and clean;Ground to till, air to breathe;With missteps for no one
When we drew this, our best plans;Imperial, with no regrets
She needs to love me still;Until I've had my fill;I try and try to leave;I want to watch you grieve
Hostile as I once was;And I once was cruel;Piles of dust immolate;All in the same room;With missteps for no one
When we drew this, our dark map;In heaven there are no regrets
Now we all dream alone;Now we all dream alone;Now we all dream alone
Am I losing faith in my own anger?;I forgot to punch Max out on my own;You drive my sin, this blue bullet hit me hard;When stimuli stays, I can't feel you, you're too far
Talk to me in whispers with bad intention;So many of us lie but you're not the worst;You drive my sin, this blue bullet hit me hard;Sweet to the taste, I can't feel you, you're too far
I once was in love before I knew you;But I've given up;I once was in love before you
Spell my name with sand and suck up the salt air;Dug deep beyond our world, a vision of hope;You drive my sin, bounce like glass against a flame;Where future structures fail, their ruins write your name
I once was in love before I knew you;But I've given up;I once was in love before you;I once was in love before I knew you;But I've given up;I once was in love before you
I'll make you sorry;I'll make you sorry
I'll medicate myself;Suspect that idols lie to me;I'll medicate myself;So that the world can lie to me
Words made out of dirt;You're dirt beneath my feet
I count absolute zero;The same way I'm held hostage;Tonal oblivion;No rooms in this desert made of light;Their emblems built of garbage;Those wheels emphatic colors;Tonal oblivion;No rooms in this desert made of light
No credit;No blame;Process is the gain
Without these gods and heroes;Whose words will hold you hostage;His canvas choked with words;Drops of inks to douse a desert fire;It brought us back to page;I see myself in bondage;Outside a house in flames;I'm blessed to burn into a desert fire
She's unseen completely;Let me under your wing;The sun destroys me;She's unseen completely;Let me under your wing;The sun destroys me
I count absolute zero;The same way I'm held hostage;Tonal oblivion;No rooms in this desert made of light;Their emblems built of garbage;Those wheels emphatic colors;Tonal oblivion;No rooms in this desert made of light
Tell the great unknown you refuse;You'll drive alone and take yourself home;Get high and quiet, ask me
Play for me that song that you wrote hysterically loud;And cry for me cause I figured it out;I figured you out
Lost in luxury;What dead family does escape with their past;Get high for entry, ask me
Play for me that song that you wrote hysterically loud;And lie to me cause I figured it out;I figured you out
All at once, you're so mean;My breath on glass, you fall asleep
So deeply;And I fall so deeply;And I fall so deeply;And I fall so deeply;And I fall so deeply;And I fall so deeply;And I fall so deeply;And I
Soft domination, hold me;Rule me captive, drain me empty;And I need you to know me;So no one else owns me
My instincts are extinct;Spit is sour and I'm pissed dry;And I need you to know me;So no one else owns me
Tell me you'll lift me up;Tell me you'll take me out of this place;Tell me you'll lift me up;Tell me you'll take me out of this place
Zero rest for the weary;Capital mass, infinite growth;And I need you to know me;So no one else owns me
They clip my claws and braid my hair;Dance on my back, my body bare;Let's bind their hands and seal their eyes;So that the blind can lead the blind
I've had enough with them, no function;You can't wipe their every tear away;And all at once, no revolution;A ghost inside and no one's safe
A sin to some, accident's dying;The desperate need to have it all;Body snatchers, death for dining;A floating house, mouth full of bones
It's the end of my bloodline;It's mine and you're greedy, it's mine;It's the end of my bloodline;It's mine and you're greedy, it's mine
There's little truth in power's timing;Its desperate need to have it all;On my device, the silver lining;Misplaced your faith, leave me alone
I need to tell you you're not wrong;Don't throw your body on the bomb;Your face a visage, it still hurts;Your gifts in flames while I watch them burn
I've been waiting a long time to see you disappear;Colored clear, make me blind
Took only moments, bored indoors;Forget me now like it was before;If this goes on I will always wait;Your head to turn while my heart breaks
I've been waiting a long time to see you disappear;Colored clear, make me blind;I've been waiting a long time to see you disappear;Colored clear, make me blind
Your stare is a gun, unlit room;Your body lit by the black moon;Make me a mantle, and say grace;Your prayer and visions slip away
I've been waiting a long time to see you disappear;Colored clear, make me blind;I've been waiting a long time to see you disappear;Colored clear
Grieve as if I died;And I'll become a fragment in your mind;I wanted you to bleed my deep veins dry;I wanted you to grieve as if I died;I wanted you
And I'd like to love me like you seem to;How do you hang this heaven over me;Nail me to the bed
Grieve as if I died;And in your fantasies I'm still alive;And braid my hair to yours to drag us blind;I wanted you to grieve as if I died;I wanted you to;I wanted you to;I wanted you
I flirt with Brancusi's gesture;I'm a bird in space;As his ghost escorts me to a magic place;I'm dressed all in colours, neither white nor black;Ask the begged question, need I come back
Sing on Olympus Mons so all the world can see;Perfection in my structure, I have all I need;There's not a single stain on my song tonight;When time is endless and I'm always right
And I'll look nice like a bird in paradise;Forever caught in mid-flight;How I long to be
Born burnt inside a black mass;A fraction less than others;A select sickness keep me hid;Ravaged by others;What craft, obsession brought me down;What men see pleasing;But who, who can I please?
You'll stare at me in a fantasy;Love me through the lens;Our memories falling on my knees;Touch me through the fence
No future, fear this ugly wave;It's more trash than water;I'm done sticking for more blood;And I just get water;Should I lay with my head bowed down?;Exist in exits;But where, where can I exist?
Where can I let the ghost in?;When rest comes easy fall asleep;Let bad men fail us all
You'll stare at me in a fantasy;Love me through the lens;Our memories falling on my knees;Touch me through the fence;You'll stare at me in a fantasy;Love me through the lens;Our memories falling on my knees;Touch me through the fence
You draw me in disguise;And paint me paralyzed, it's true;You trace me as you see;The darkest color, deepest blue;I'm heavy in this chair;Sharp corners frame my back;While you draw me in disguise;And paint me paralyzed, it's true
I tried to draw you too;But in bad taste and with poor choice;And I can't paint like you do;Tragic precision, perfect void;I'm sleeping in this chair;While you sleep in the hallway;You draw me in disguise;And paint me paralyzed, it's true
When they come to find me;Then please burn my body;When they come to find me;Then please burn my body
A broad stroke extinguishes this fire;Paint me screaming into the sprawl
I am growing old, I'm drunk in your home;Gather your fears because I'm done
I am growing old, too drunk in your home;There is no complex to complexity;So you won't hear a peep out of me
I am growing old, too drunk in your home;To latch myself sealed shut;Day by day and drop by drop
Day by day and drop by drop;Day by day and drop by drop
Near the entrance you call me;'Cause today might be the day;I know;Everyone wants to see a show
I'm sick with worry just knowing;When you step outside you won't be safe now;I'm sick with worry just knowing;When you step outside you won't be safe
They'll drop you dry if you let them;Don't give it all up to the grave;I know;Everyone wants to see a show
'Cause today might be the day;I know
You're in rapture, my dear;If you ever come near;Hell's belt with a frown;Turn your town upside down;And here's a little with youth;Silly coy and uncouth;I will settle you down;When your menace surrounds
From serene to the sick;Many coils that stick;To all our leather boots;Rattled with fickled truth;And I am tired of your mouth;When you're talking about;The injustice of speech;On a bus to the beach
The heat up here's divided time;With earthly men on concubine;And circles strangled clever girls;Who dress up in their mother's pearls
I remember you still;Yellow fangs and sick pills;Sucking on your own blood;Calling cards to crack up;In a forest with beasts;Our old lady found peace;Grabbed its tail with her teeth;And drove her son into the sea
I saw a pilgrim;And it was electric;They bought some guns;They bought some corn
I'm gonna chase you down the street;Goin' excess speeds of three
Beneath myself, how holidays go;This borne child with stupendous host;They told me so;I thought you should know
A face of flies;The hands of murder collide;Your mom ain't home;I'm gonna catch you alone
Needles slide to the dropping slope;And infant with twin talents;They told me so;I thought you should know
I stand upright, see?;Elizabeth is on her knees;And I hang little tacs;On the rail of her back;Placemat, manuscript;Sends information to the trip;Acid wash T.V. runs static;On channel three
The blood beard charge;The singer has scars;It etches my name;In the hall of fame
Jim Real spends his time;And plans dates with his aunt;And Sue is watching crimes;On television start and stop;But we don't watch T.V;No, and we do not thread the cops;Through streets pass my lead;Or where the ocean rocks
The smartest person up for sale;Did you hear about the killer whale?;Yeah, I know him very well
The elderly, they make their peace;They're choking on their rosary beads;Yeah, I know them very well
I lend my hands to dissonance;And participate in a deadly dance;Yeah, I - I am quite aware
And in this band of coventry;Hang by steel noose, up in that tree;Yeah, I - I am quite aware
The hand and what we feel;The bearded lady is real;I know her very well
I feel my temperature rise;You can't hear me though;And when I reach down inside;It's dead in telephone;I am the mistake of embryotic drool;When I come climbing up, out of the ooze
Camouflage the religion;Smell the consequence;Oh I am runnin' a fire that's lit in seven beds;Inside the maker I do not have such time;Cut your camera in hopes our line rewinds
The spade of man is pushing up;With all their fractured wrists, good general;Burning our childhood homes;With turpentine;Inside their siamese wounds;It's death and dying
Swim in the swill, we will;On the kitchen floor;And wrap my bones in birds;For a real good cause;Oh, mother Mary;She holds me in her arms;We're strapped to a tanker;In a warring world
See all these dinosaurs?;Oh, they want to rule the world
I'm ready to wash my hands of you;Next time you bring me more bad news;I'm ready to wash my hands of you;Next time you bring me more bad news;I'm ready
We can all share sports;Let's play together;We can all share sports;Let us play together;There is no crying in baseball
Drowning yourself in a sea of dysentery;And animals dead on their backs;You hurry to switchblade the maker of paper;With stitches that wind down her hat
In your shoes and the mistake of martians;That buzz in my brain like a seed;And a leech on the index of a holy subject;Will algebra bite till it bleeds
This is satan's song;You must sing along
What planet abandons me;It is the thrill of Baby Jesus;I am not afraid
Kids and cops eat rock hard earth;To piss in lakes and meet their maker;I am not afraid
Through all these trials;And horrors of progress;I need you;To come back, my friend;And in this sad story;I burn up my costume;That ate my insides;In prison
In right eye with slip the forest;A highway and clever fire;I am not afraid
One foul swoop on the jaw of man;May pull apart his frame;In for the money, I'm suspect;To me it's just the same
Golden tongues for more respect;And some quiet time;Kiss the carpet, you're suspect;To me it's just the same
You'll have me with or without;Until our ship floats away
Maybe the day that she met mama;Her tiny fingers framed;Her face, in light it was so flawless;That she was a ghost
Ok, it's fine to hold her ransom;On her wedding day;Deflowered, reviled and tossed aside;It's useless anyway
I find your son dead in the alley;I find your friends decayed;I see sour grapes on the table;For all the guests to take
I'll run back home in the old man's slippers;And take the widest route;So I can see the west;And what animals i should shoot
Okay, i beat the beanbag open;The kids cried in their seats;Parenting, it just seems to hopeless;With the way they look at me
The beast was born;He slithered out of his hole;I starve my pets;Chained to a linked fence
I am forced to guard the mile;You are not my mother's child;History is at the door;They tell secrets in their sleep;You wake up and wet the sheets;My good friend is at the door
Boys in big shoes;Make authority look so cool;And you french the ground;On the other side of our town
Relax my bones;Put my nail on the gramophone;Sounds of the week;Are always so bittersweet
Eighteen hours I tooled the worst;Getting older could bounce back best;Nothing could prepare you for this
Since my blood was stolen;My heart has been dying;Since my blood was stolen;My heart has been dying
My bones are my teachers, but I have none;D.U. birth defects emit and bombs;Your young gas masked task force, stomp them out;My bones are my teachers, but I have none
Love was made for all high school queens;And their faces angle in seams;You can watch it all on TV
My bones are my teachers, but I have none;If skin sheds I'm worthless, so hide your sons;My void is my person, a heart to home;Visit and you'll find yourself alone
I have found a way to steep myself under the ground;And all the million ways you'd convince me to be found;But this ship is cast, my routine is in the can;We will paint this town, you will see how brave I am
I have found the sense, a haunted house, a starving dog;If you come back to me, then I will drag you along;And only you can breathe, in the center of the lake;Will the summer girls, I will give and you can take
Office of the brave;I look into your eyes
Let's not all forget about feeling;And frame it through the hole in your skull;Let's not all forget about feeling;The big gun always forgets
Lights out for sally at midnight;She doesn't listen when I say;Ears to the ground eyes in the sky;She doesn't listen when I say
Old men are awake and dreaming;Young girls lip the sides of their graves;Let's not all forget about feeling;The big gun always forgets
Let's not all forget about feeling;I would love to forget about love;Let's not all forget about feeling;The big gun always forgets
You aimed right for the eyes;Where your invitation dies;And I am subject to irrelevance;And all your secret spies
You'll be the nexus in the dark;I'll be the spade that digs your grave;Youth is bored, youth is short;Youth is for the brave
I believe in evil;I believe in evil
You whistle all the tunes;And you irrigate the wounds;You are a prisoner best left unkempt;Propped up alive by fools
Next to a black hole by the clock;Where all information stops;Youth is bored, youth is short;Youth is for the brave
There is no wrong way to read this book, my darling;Please come sit down by me and have a look at scripture
Forward on the right;When day turns into night;Muscles flexed, your turn is next;Join in the fight;Baby, they're waitin' for you
I've had enough, this rolling laugh;No captions on the photograph;So I play on;If you're miserable, it's clear now;We never liked you anyhow;So I play on
When I die don't leave;I'll take it all with me;And if you need a nail to save;Jump into my grave;Baby, he's waitin' for you
Down by the corner, half back hotel;I spoke with murder, I spoke with hell;I pulled the peach pit, I stirred the way;How do you do it the modern way?
Halfway down the stairs is where I tend to sit;I coast the north and south chewing at the bit;I'm nursing on the bill and scraping at the hide;Everybody knows that I lied
She had no pain, she saw the queen;Zipped up his pants, what does it mean?;Trouble at home, trouble abroad;A stuffy room with no crowd at all
Stretch your legs to fill the coffin;Vacation in your clothes;Casual friday;It's all a mess;When affairs are exposed
The curtains part;The shades are flesh;Second hands turn to knives;You are buried in the nude
Invitations in the face;They suffer for the bored;Holy wars;Dark lithium;When affairs are exposed
I bet you want it;These are the greatest times;Oh i bet you need it to feed;I bet you need it to feed
This is a nice place that you've been living in;All processed in cans;Tricking black ponies into a crippled dance;Buried in the sand
You are always talking and you never stop;The faceless foreign few;And all the girl's guts in between your teeth;Grow roots into you
I am a victim of the general public;The sirens scream my name;I am the man in the general public;But my voice remains the same
Sick and tired of the major leagues;You'd better watch your mouth;I'll do what I please;With them sordid eyes;The mystery lies in me
The real mothers;In the meat locker;The damn youth
Eye for eye with your lazy speech;And your naked lunch;While the preachers preach;Scum for dinner;The cost of killing is free
Spent four long years;My heart displaced;Fishnets and recess;A foreign face;Your wreck and reign;Will dig my grave;Your pretty face;Will dig my
I was walking in the sand;Making war in my hands;I'm sorry that you are weak;Swing in so slow;My clean sheets
I was blinded in the park;Caught in steep, infinite dark;I'm sorry that you aren't quick;Your blank friendly associates
Humanity arranged;I've been lying to you all along
I was walking in the sand;Making war in my hands;This is glorious love;This was sent from above
Everyone has the music they love;Like a showgirl in a fugue of childbirth;The matron's orders to the back of the room;I've seen him all sewn to the floor;A christian demon and family boy;Brought up by the school bus route
Samantha starves the beat;She starves;And drives a man insane
I went on into this little girl's room;All those monsters and their x-ray cartoons;Project lines to the back of your mind;Pulling you out of the second floor door;Out of sorts into a collapsing hall;And into the white light
When you wake up you'll be awake forever;Parents coming through the windows tell her;This might force them to remember
Everyone has the music they love;Forwarding into an age of nervous;Boys and girls locked up in their rooms;When you grow old you will reflect fondly;Upon the unions and the memories of me;And we will never age at all
I sense your friends across the room;Leaning, tall, and deathly ill;An animal inside the walls;Born in the bathroom stalls
When you were young you dare not speak;And leisure moved from week to week;You'd want me to
I feel and stop and folding now;It will be over;And with eight snakes the earth will drown;It will be over;With little anne
They lived to build a bridge;Between heaven and the sea;Till lady madonna drowned me;Peter tom and will;Do not trust those pretty girls;They will only break your heart
This is how i link the needle and the kids;I will not see;I will not feel;The senses mute;This is how i tuck the children in their beds;Their time will come soon
I'll make a safe distance;And free my life of consequence;And lay my brother in his grave
Sunk into the film;Keep the offer stale;Mind the platform;Stay in good form;Sink into the drill
I stole them while dying;My return to heaven;I stole them while dying;My return to heaven
When you keep a fight;I pass your room at night;Pinned to the brain;Birthed the insane;Set your TV live
I know the best girls sleep;In store bought beds as teams;I hope your skull bursts;Banned and spilled guts;Slithered into bed
Back to where I stand;My life in quartered plans;I sleep with monsters;Bit and tortured;Grasping for the strands
I was on the road to heaven;When he found me;I was cheering on the tracks;And he found me dead;Water boarding;Dead
I was a real shot gun;When he found me;Taking over the world;And he found me dead
I will tear the heads off this culture;Make my presence known;I will shut your mouth;I will nail the heads on this culture;Make my presence known;I will shut your mouth
The blood of family doesn't help;I put myself back on the shelf;If mother knows best then mother knows why;My Earth's gone flat and the sun burns sour;The blood of family doesn't help;I put myself back on the shelf;If mother knows best then mother knows why
You have found the monsters that make us wonder;Who has human skin?;The mistakes born;That you'd be so very happy;In a dog pile of great men
I try my best;To make it home;And your services;I'll cut them off
Pull me out of the stairs;Oh, the truth
I have found the people that live inside;The dust balloons on mars;Never mind the boring fortunate fathers;Processed in the morgues;
Based in different houses that a ran a road;Between yours and mine;Feigning smiles in the vast echo of space;And biding all our time
When she was 19;She had a fever;But the office was now closed;When she was 19;Pushing the window;Into her parent's home
Is that your boyfriend;Is that your girlfriend;With all this nonsense;Prevent confusion
She is our miscreant;She is our detox;She is our dagger in the dark;She is the knot mess;She is the undressed;She is the boy borne in my heart
While you sit on the fence I will burn in hell
You take what's mine;And face me like you're blind;It all means nothing;I'll break the curse;And show you what I'm worth;A broken hand
I'm on a mission to smash the mirror;Get myself off the scale;I'm gonna forget so I can see clearer;Get myself off the shelf
I want to buy everything that you sell;It all means nothing;I want to burn;You show me who is worse;The other man
It's not so hard to find;You grace me with your clues;It keeps me strange and awful like;I've saved it all for you;Force me to decide;Help me
I knew the nerves laced through your throat;Splintered your bones going for broke
Please don't let the mystery end;So I won't be forgotten;Let's drown the trend and make it end;I'll never let you go
I'll be sitting on the base;Effects are furious;The boiler smokes, I hear it blow;I'll never let you go
I'm a rotten apple;I'm a rotten apple;I'm a rotten apple
You're drawing signals in the snow;With a breath that spins my name;These awful things spread out in dreams;I'll never let you go
I'll be sitting on the base;Swallowing pounds of sand;The boiler smokes, I hear it blow;I'll never let you go
Heaven forgive me;Heaven forgot me now;Hell is within me;Hell's all around me now
The block is quiet and the tree bends;I walk into our house;Where all the doors are open;You are lost and I'm found;I'm working on nothing;Extinction is dead
I walk the floor;You made the rules;And you've made me a fool;A mind declined you mute my final note
I won't light your candles;And I won't hold your door;Mystics have seen forever;But I want so much more;I'm working on nothing;Extinction is dead
I heard the bad guy is me;I pierce his flesh I'm a mom;Grieving his harrowing breed;I swear he brought me along
Mirrors, dark spells;The first spin through hell;If we push the altar;Can we watch it burn?
It's my red hand;It's my red hand;It's my red hand;It's my red hand
I'm tied to the rack;Sharp bones, bareback;And I hold the chain;It covers my name
You sit where I stood;I try hard to be good;Our excess on deck;Darts through the wreck
Help me, I want to be clean;Locked in the stall;Bounce off the tile, bore my screams;Right through the wall
I'll work for it;I'll work for it;I'll work for it;I'll work for it
Killer instinct, I can't relax;Head's on the slab but I can't react;And with constant contact, the line is drawn;I guess I let it go on too long
Four more blocks 'til I get back home;Backseat of the car in the city's hum;And a teenage beast smokes behind the wheel;Nobody knows just how I feel
I don't get high;I can't unwind;I don't get high;I can't unwind
It's all my fault when I hit the slab;I'm a line to snort and a drag to pass;When you roll up the ad, we will make it fair;I want everyone out of my hair
'Cause I don't get high;I can't unwind;I don't get high;I can't unwind
If no one's listening in, I'd like to pull apart the core of you;And squeeze myself back in;And if we can't make friends, then I will live my life in servitude;And you can watch me beg
I want to have faith in you, be wild and wander;I want you to tell me to expire
Stack your pills for autumn 'cause you ought to live your memories;In void and erase the page;And as my cells expand and the earth shakes;The sea recedes and sneaks me in;Now I can see
Every week I wait for you to bring me home or break my back;Or sling me through the noose;The burning tree and strongest hand, the soil of the earth, it bends;And I die eternally
I'll mess your makeup, show me again;I can reduce you and I can pretend;It's handfuls, crow's nest;Help me forget
I've made a prison so I can't get too far;Made it my mission to analyze the scar
I want to beg you, put out the fire;Read me the reasons, show me the shots;I sow the seeds for;Hands that feed me
This blister's skip on the surface;I'm deep with blood in the tub;Shameless, I'm dancing with the black dove;I'm burnt and inked with a dark brand;Boring, sulking through the sieve;I think I've offered you all I can give
I'm in our old room, stroke on the sun;Give me good reasons because I have none;Your reach exceeds;All my needs
I want to keep the weakest one;I want to make him mine;Salvation born within my hands;Ah, ah, ah, ah;I want to feed him every pill;And breed the gift of life;All my faith just keeps me ill;Ah, ah, ah, ah;Ah!
Your tiny hands pursue my heart;You wind me in the womb;There's nothing left to tear apart;Ah, ah, ah, ah;Every crime that hangs its head;Burns for someone else;You drink my blood and knock me dead;Ah, ah, ah, ah
All my intentions are bred by the worst;Inheriting the family curse;And as I grow older and dig a hole in the Earth;I bury my enemy's birth;
Over the median, pushing through time;Scratching a hole through the wall;And I suspect your secrets slipped through my hands;With not a single one too small
Give me grief, my only strength;Hang me in the square;Tell me that it's wrong to beg;Ah, ah, ah, ah;I'm building up the great below;I'm breaking all your parts;Hold me down and tell me no;Ah, ah, ah, ah
My fingers swarm the gun;As blinding as the sun;But I've got to point it to the right;And fascinate the night;That begs to mourn the moon;The ditch I dug too soon;So that every dog and man jumps to land
I'm a believer hanging on your thumb;Leave it all up to me;Make me your martyr, I'll navigate your blood;Leave it all up to me
A baby in the crib;Is when the engine splits;And youth just runs over the winded;So our future is hindered;By absentees and deaths;New lovers taking breaths;In between their vows for forever;They pay the price
I drag the pen for Lucifer;Help me now to find the cure;When I drag the pen for Lucifer;Help me now to find the cure
And it's better always;To hand over the key;And it's better always;I can't let go
My visions have been lies;Deep fire in the sky;A sound that turns the mountains into sand;The dirt that won't wash clean;The blade that splits the team;The holy war that breaks your shell
Life was built to bore you;If you can't plant the seed;I flip the open casket on its side;Born to bind your seizure;I'm harassed in the night;I can't believe my luck is so unreal
If you can't heal me, let's find a way;To satisfy all my needs;I'm blinking red, I'm one beat too short;Satisfied, I always want much more
I stitched the great divide;I raked the dirt of life;I threw it into the infinite sea
Help me make encounters;Lift me up to the light;A crown between each knuckle spins the wheel;I'm swinging on your meathook;I'm choking on your breath;I can't believe my luck is so unreal
I need you to show me;What your genius can do;So I can hide;You're piss on my pillow;You're filth in my veins;And I will make sure that I don't;Make mistakes, mistakes, mistakes
My visions have been lies;Deep fire in the sky;A sound that turns the mountains into sand;Baked in the morning sunrise, blown over into night;Tripping on the grief that pulls my tongue;I'm blessed to be forgotten and pinned at home;To rot;I can't believe my luck is so unreal
You wanna make me older;But I can't grow again;If you won't let me meet you;I've got no hand to lend;You gotta help me help myself
You send me up to heaven;And that's where I saw God;I want that old eternal;I want to show you off;You gotta help me help myself
There's a map inside of the world I know;When you leave me at home alone and I'm trapped;And I feel it on the way down
You make it look easy to be strong;You lift my crutch and drive me home;On the rails of the night;But you shouldn't let me drive;My thoughts just drag me through the dirt;A fiction in my mind made to burn;On the rails of the night;But you shouldn't let me drive
I get on well with old friends;With no time for the new;I'm focusing to tune out;I want to erase you;You gotta help me help myself
How will the music play for;The crooked lines and hooks?;I want to learn your letters;And rewrite all the books;You gotta help me help myself
When you tell me that you don't care;I want to make sure you're aware that I do;And I feel it on the way down
I'll push your plates and make your change;Masking the facts, it's all the same and it's bad;And I feel it on the way down
It's with nothing gained I spoil the joys in my life;We are rushed to a stark memory;And a pile of ashes rake the rust of the earth;Ripping leaves off of my family tree;I reach in the deepest drain, I fall in the race;
Making murder and stalking the swarm;I've prayed for recovery and took the time to say;"You've been warned";You make it look easy to be strong;You lift my crutch and drive me home;On the rails of the night;But you shouldn't let me drive
My thoughts just drag me through the dirt;A fiction in my mind made to burn;On the rails of the night;But you shouldn't let me drive
Help me help my;Help me help my;Help me help my;Help me help myself
I wanna show you something ugly;I want the boss to tell you off;I want the earth to quake and make mistakes;Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah;Let us all give way to agreement;And carve a fat line in the sand;Weave my hand through the gun, it weighs a ton;Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah
Put mama on the phone;I'm afraid to die alone
I cast a scene reborn in regret;I taste the sour things you made;And I feel bad for you but I'm the fool;Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah;I want the big grey sky to open;I want the truth to melt away;Fire in the tiger's eye, blood on the bride;Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah
Well, stupid is as stupid does it;But I always do it wrong;I'm gonna come in last and take the pass;Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah;I wanna show you something ugly;I want the boss to tell you off;I want the earth to quake and make mistakes;Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah
My red ribbon's soaked with success, my baby is born;Life won't wait at heaven's gate, it burns;I tear your sleep with long, white fingers, bless my stupid mouth;You're just another nail in my house
I see her face in the garden, planting a white rose;It casts a seed, it turns the latch, it grows
I keep my wires under glass to blink my evil eye;I drown the cross and sand it down, bone dry;Who will rock the cradle when my hands are forced to lie?;My ego sinks, my gate is slight, I die
It's been a slow birth;Red blood, slow birth
I can't trace the word;It's a swollen space it talks to me;And if I'm bought and sold;Then I'm cruising in on a dead end street
They take me out;They make it fair;And everyone is running scared;The biggest joke;The brightest smile;I feel just like a little child;And it's nice, nice, nice to feel
Put me in your head;Drown the rat that gnaws at me;Your blood is on the bed;And I'm crushed under your memory
A complex noose that hangs at high noon;A choir is gagged and stabbed with a spoon;I drove to crash the globe and be in;Pieces of leather sewn to your hair;On constant watch and white wrist repair;You know me well inside and I know you
Record, a fool's record;A fool's record
This spiral is so easy to do;You leech and I'm for sale;I made my way across the room;But my time is over now;Setting sights on what you have done;Pouring bleach onto my lawn;I took the only avenue;And my time is over now
My absence is all that you need;It's so much easier to conceive;And rob us blind to bag the sockets too;Fell from up in the trees;Here is Cupid covered in bees;A sign with all his sour wings I drew
This spiral is so easy to do;You leech and I'm for sale;I made my way across the room;My time is over now;Setting sights on what you have done;Pouring bleach onto my lawn;I took the only avenue;And my time is over now
You are either going to die or you're already dead;My mission, get up, get up now, stitched to the bed;Another mouth to feed, it will get better;Sewn to sides, it will get better;Holy licking wounds
The only friend I ever knew;Were the silent sounds of these ghosts in bloom;I need to wrap my head around;All these empty scenes 'cause you knock me out;Knock me out, you knock me out
You are either going to hell or you're already there;Smart parties, get up, get up now, nothing was there;Another mouth to feed, it will get better;Bound to shame, it will get better;Holy licking wounds
Send the wire to the boss;The bones in the back room;It's buried in the backyard;Because he died too soon
Sitting on the couch;Cinema all alone;Backtrack to your secret house;Parents can never know
I just wanna come over;To burn and sell the estate;I just wanna come over;And stay
Backtrack to your secret house;I drive to get your mail;Burning in my perfect life;Determined we can't fail
When they number off the dead;I will haul the ashes there;And make certain you were one of them;And in my infant dreams of hope;You will billow up in smoke;And fill my little pink lungs
You may not find it hard;You drag my feet;You pull me to the ground;This is costing you in skin
I am sister to your tunes;Fortunate waddle while you swoon;Spanking boy is on the whipping post;His features melt into his mouth;While we're burning down the house;What a puddle of friends we have now
You make me feel so enlightened;Like a lady found God in her purse;Lord in the store we are bringing it in;Pays in the red and it's worse
How will he take the news?;Good or bad, red or blue;Holds the victim and he folds the night;No exception to the rule;Motel 6, your check is due;Adult life is calling you
You make me feel so enlightened;Like a lady found God in her purse
Someone has friends on the rebound;And she is a model of you;I saw a speech last for hours;Maybe next week we'll spend in the dirt
I dig on calculus;I shift cars with canine too;I read your diary and it leaks through;You know, you know I do
I shift on moving forms;Sway to, not back and forth;Brave soldier, tight your belt;Know the bible and your health;And it leaks through
I made cigarette burns in the center of your room;Outlined by the legs of a bug on its back;I poured salt from my palm in the center of your room;Slow and steadily built a bridge on your back
Ancient civilization;Bring me into your arms;Drain the river that feeds me;You just can't wait to meet me;I'd like to ask the host, can I please stay?;Making the most of our last days
Lean into the turn, keeping the pyramid's eye peeled;Three dark stars set in, sink, do the dead man's float;Our nine planets align, mimic linear dance moves;And we haven't got time left to choose
Ancient civilization;Bring me into your arms;Drain the river that feeds me;You just can't wait to meet me;I'd like to ask the host, can I please stay?;Making the most of our last days;Peeling the rind 'til it feels good
Crunch your numbers with pause, yield implausible 13;Punching cards for the gods so we're charged for the cost;Match the mirror's reflection and see what I see;The mirage is in charge, we'll show them who's boss
Now you spit a heavy word;It's draining weight I pass;The halfway point, his story starts;You can't have what I have;I spoil the seed, swallow the pill;Cracking with the whip;A broken heel is on the bill
I'm gonna need your condescension;To be wide awake;Dragging my heart station to station;I'll just fade away
I spied on you behind the ghost;Now shadow grinds its jaw;A pointed run, blessed to work;Towards nothing at all;My guts in all your ashes burn;Like embers in a pipe;Take my hand, it's your turn
I'm gonna need your condescension;To be wide awake;Dragging my heart station to station;I'll just
Let me in there;Everyone is on their way, please wake up
My heart won't take it easy;A fractured pace, devoid of sense;That every time I spin its hands, it splinters;Chattering, shimmering;Crushed in the hand I held it in;So small and fragile, clear as glass, it splinters
'Cause my coin is tossed;My pain is boss;I'm wrapped in your wire
Dripping blood on the highway;Beneath the Montana sky;Cruising a course to hit the brakes, I'm under;True silence for the night;One perfect moment stuck in flight;I'm pulling out the feather and I'm under
Yeah;Skeleton's wing;On a skeleton's wing
With you, I can't get by;As mothers move in private quarters;Pushed atop the ledge with the wise guys;They're searching for that stone;Stuck to the bottom;Forced to fire the torch on the fourth of July
And though it's only momentary;I have what I want;I leave our portrait fragmentary;I have what I want
I've seen you comb the queue;Illicit to drain the big blue sky;A fracture on the face of mercurial birth;A vine burst through the curb;You never wake up;No matter how much I think it's worth
Our stunts are regressing, we're naked and boring;Let's take it all back, I'm taking it back;Taking it back, I'm taking it;Taking it back, I'm taking it;Taking it back, I'm taking it;Taking it back, I'm taking it back
Admission is a chore;A cog inside the spinning wheel;That spits up as it turns near the earth's core;Who has the city key?;I'll never wake up;Slam my swollen fist into the door;Into the door
He came dancing across the water;With his galleons and guns;Looking for the new world;In that palace in the sun
On the shore lay Montezuma;With his coca leaves and pearls;In his halls he wondered;With the secrets of the worlds
And his subjects gathered 'round him;Like the leaves around a tree;In their clothes of many colors;For the angry gods to see
And the women all were beautiful;And the men stood straight and strong;They offered life in sacrifice;So that others could go on
Hate was just a legend;And war was never known;The people worked together;And they lifted many stones
They carried them to the flatlands;And they died along the way;But they built up with their bare hands;What we cannot build today
And I know she's living there;And she loves me to this day;I still can't remember when;Or how I lost my way
He came dancing across the water;Cortez, Cortez;What a killer
I've been long, a long way from here;Put on a poncho, played for mosquitoes;And drank 'til I was thirsty again;We went searching through thrift store jungles;Found Geronimo's rifle, Marilyn's shampoo;And Benny Goodman's corset and pen
Well, okay, I made this up;I promised you I'd never give up
If it makes you happy;It can't be that bad;If it makes you happy;Then why the hell are you so sad?
You get down, real low down;You listen to Coltrane, derail your own train;Well, who hasn't been there before?;I come round, around the hard way;Bring you comics in bed, scrape the mold off the bread;And serve you French toast again
Well, okay, I still get stoned;I'm not the kind of girl you'd take home
If it makes you happy;It can't be that bad;If it makes you happy;Then why the hell are you so sad?;If it makes you happy;It can't be that bad;If it makes you happy;Then why the hell are you so sad?
We've been far, far away from here;Put on a poncho, played for mosquitoes;And everywhere in between
Well, okay, we get along;So what if right now everything's wrong?
Many years we spent unpressured;That we felt so swell;Love the times of simple pleasures;Only time will tell
Oh, this is not to say;We are not the way we used to be
And we were not so fond of reason;Everyone could tell;Even times we'd start to stumble;But never ever fell
Oh, this is not to say;We were not the worst we've ever been
Fools and kings decide;Ways to live your life;This is just the way we want to be
I stay out too late;Got nothing on my brain;And that's what people say, ooh;That's what people say;I go on too many dates;But I can't make them stay;And that's what people say, ooh;That's what people say
So I keep cruising;Can't stop, won't stop moving;It's like I've got this music in my mind;Saying it's gonna be alright
'Cause the players gonna play, play, play, play, play;And the haters gonna hate, hate, hate, hate, hate;I'm just gonna shake, shake, shake, shake, shake;Shake it off
Heartbreakers gonna break, break, break, break, break;And the fakers gonna fake, fake, fake, fake, fake;I'm just gonna shake, shake, shake, shake, shake;Shake it off
I never miss a beat;I'm lightning on my feet;And that's what they don't see, ooh;That's what they don't see;I'm dancing on my own;I'll make the rules up as I go;And that's what they don't know, mmm;That's what they don't know
So I keep cruising;Can't stop, won't stop grooving;It's like I've got this music in my mind;Saying it's gonna be alright
Shake it off, shake it off;I, I shake it off, shake it off;Oh, I shake it off, shake it off;I shake it off
Hey, hey, hey;Just think when you were getting down and out;About all the liars and dirty cheats in the world;You could've been getting down to this sick beat
'Cause the players gonna play, play, play, play, play;And the haters gonna hate, hate, hate, hate, hate;I'm just gonna shake, shake, shake, shake, shake;Shake it off;Heartbreakers gonna break, break, break, break, break;And the fakers gonna fake;I'm just gonna shake;Shake it off
Shake it off, shake it off;I shake it off, shake it off;Oh, I shake it off, shake it off;I shake it off;I shake it off, shake it off;I shake it off, shake it off;Oh, I shake it off, shake it off;I shake it off
I used to be lunatic for those gracious days;I used to be woebegone and so restless nights;My aching heart would bleed for you to see;Oh, but now;(I don't find myself bouncing home;Whistling buttonhole tunes to make me cry)
No more "I love you's";The language is leaving me;No more "I love you's";Changes are shifting outside the word
I used to have demons in my room at night;Desire, despair, desire, so many monsters;Oh, but now;(I don't find myself bouncing home;Whistling buttonhole tunes to make me cry)
No more "I love you's";The language is leaving me;No more "I love you's";The language is leaving me in silence;No more "I love you's";Changes are shifting outside the word
You've mapped out my lie and it ain't good for me;And I follow all your orders 'cause there's a whole big world to see;And I sit back and think of how I used to be;Yeah, there ain't nothing left to do but dream
What if all these fantasies come rushing in at night?;But it's just too far for the ancients to allow;And I'm trapped at home just waiting for my baby doll;I know it's over now
Take me now baby here as I am;Pull me close, try and understand;Desire is a hunger it's the fire I breathe;Love is a banquet on which we feed
Come on now try and understand;The way I feel when I'm in your hands;Take my hand come undercover;They can't hurt you now;Can't hurt you now;Can't hurt you now
Because the night belongs to lovers;Because the night belongs to lust;Because the night belongs to lovers;Because the night belongs to us
Have I doubt when I'm alone;Love is a ring, the telephone;Love is an angel disguised as lust;Here in our bed until the morning comes
Come on now try and understand;The way I feel under your command;Take my hand as the sun descends;They can't touch you now;Can't touch you now, can't hurt you now
With love we sleep;With doubt this vicious circle turns and burns;Without you I cannot live;Forgive the yearning burning;I believe it's time;Too real to feel;So touch me now;Touch me now;Touch me now
You're my shotgun;Straight to hell;You promised you'd never tell;Your chapped lips and fingertips;A foolish waltz through all of this;Wiped pure for you;I'm clean for you;Scream inside the machine for you;Hide inside the echoes of your mind, so
It's bad enough;I dream about you;You swallow the world;To warn the moon
Trim the film;Make me a star;A worm inside the killing jar;Tie the fiber tight;What's yours was mine;Bled white for you;Stabbed blind for you;Burn up inside the night for you;Hide inside the echoеs of your mind, so
The gap between your wings;Grace swinging in my head;Beside this heavy ring;I brought you;My heart;My heart
If she calls I'm in the wash;The water's brown;My skin is soft;Drink the water;Caked in shit;It's time
I'll wait for you;Stand straight for you;I became what I hate for you;Hide inside the echoes of your mind, so
My heart is a river through the sand
I'm a champion, it's in my blood now;I'm a total loss;No grounds for resource, I'll say I was forced;Lean over the bar
Shatter the night, glass in my bed;Crown pierce my palm, hole in my head;What splendid fiction, take me back;I spit and curse and so
If you want trial by blood;Then I'll never get enough;I wish you'd love me and hold me;Your cancer's controlling
Then I went mad, stretched to full stop;Drop her on the head;Blamе my sorrow, blame agony;Stick me 'til I'm bled
Why can't you see that I need you?;A pеrfect diamond dipped in glue;We're burnt alive, the distant sea;A shadow throws to me
Hang my feet over the edge;Where everything's forgotten;You have built this giant hole where I live;Cooked a feast to fascinate;A mouthful keeps me hoping;Cruel enough to blame and damned to forgive
Why can't you see that I need you?;A perfect diamond dipped in glue;We're burnt alive, the distant sea;Late afternoon, you can see me
I stroll in your house;I'm a lazy guest;Soaked in my wet shoes;I'm making a mess;Driving drunk while you steer;Pat me on the back;Left my clothes in your room;So I can come back
One last move;Let's start to begin;The pastor;Takes turns with my twin;One last move;You can't miss the mile;Disaster;Arriving in style
I thought it would stop;I watched you leave;I swallow your coil;In ecstasy;I thought it would stop;I watched you leave;Now you got it
Through an open window;Warm winds come apart;The light hits your face;Its unassuming, marked;But what ugly portraits your curator shows;Spit my wine in the sink;Who will drive me home?
You never;Notice when I leave;Risking faith;You take what you need;Such anger;Is growing in me;No longer;Who I used to be
You never miss;A gnat;A smear;A slick of oil;But I need you here
You dragged your drum;Put hammers in my head;Composed by night;Charity in your bed;The endless night is still;I'll wait until I'm dead
I can't ask for more;I'll drink until I'm sure;The one who you adore
My violence, my anger;They get in my way;You spew filth for fortune;The fans calls you brave
Despondency;Beside me in the chase;We swerve for light;A vision to embrace;The endless night is still;Let's gather up it's pace
She twists through the street;In ideal symmetry;Her shadow in the leaves
I could see your figure;It was near but so far away;And it slid into the ocean;Now in a golden state
You can place your right hand;Upon my sleeping head;And we can twist like two vines;But I wish I were dead
Didion wrote me;Stories about the waves;Shet set fire to the ocean;Let the city burn for days
If we had a quarrel;And you fell from a great height;I'd carry your big bones;And you'd be my dead wife
