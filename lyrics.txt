A complex noose that hangs at high noon
A choir is gagged and stabbed with a spoon
I drove to crash the globe and be in
Pieces of leather sewn to your hair
On constant watch and white wrist repair
You know me well inside and I know you

Record, a fool's record
A fool's record

This spiral is so easy to do
You leech and I'm for sale
I made my way across the room
But my time is over now
Setting sights on what you have done
Pouring bleach onto my lawn
I took the only avenue
And my time is over now

My absence is all that you need
It's so much easier to conceive
And rob us blind to bag the sockets too
Fell from up in the trees
Here is Cupid covered in bees
A sign with all his sour wings I drew

Record, a fool's record
A fool's record

This spiral is so easy to do
You leech and I'm for sale
I made my way across the room
But my time is over now
Setting sights on what you have done
Pouring bleach onto my lawn
I took the only avenue
And my time is over now

This spiral is so easy to do
You leech and I'm for sale
I made my way across the room
My time is over now
Setting sights on what you have done
Pouring bleach onto my lawn
I took the only avenue
And my time is over now

You are either going to die or you're already dead
My mission, get up, get up now, stitched to the bed
Another mouth to feed, it will get better
Sewn to sides, it will get better
Holy licking wounds

The only friend I ever knew
Were the silent sounds of these ghosts in bloom
I need to wrap my head around
All these empty scenes 'cause you knock me out
The only friend I ever knew
Were the silent sounds of these ghosts in bloom
I need to wrap my head around
All these empty scenes 'cause you knock me out
Knock me out, you knock me out

You are either going to hell or you're already there
Smart parties, get up, get up now, nothing was there
Another mouth to feed, it will get better
Bound to shame, it will get better
Holy licking wounds

The only friend I ever knew
Were the silent sounds of these ghosts in bloom
I need to wrap my head around
All these empty scenes 'cause you knock me out
The only friend I ever knew
Were the silent sounds of these ghosts in bloom
I need to wrap my head around
All these empty scenes 'cause you knock me out
Knock me out, you knock me out

The only friend I ever knew
Were the silent sounds of these ghosts in bloom
I need to wrap my head around
All these empty scenes 'cause you knock me out
The only friend I ever knew
Were the silent sounds of these ghosts in bloom
I need to wrap my head around
All these empty scenes 'cause you knock me out
Knock me out, you knock me out

Send the wire to the boss
The bones in the back room
It's buried in the backyard
Because he died too soon

Sitting on the couch
Cinema all alone
Backtrack to your secret house
Parents can never know

I just wanna come over
To burn and sell the estate
I just wanna come over
And stay

Backtrack to your secret house
I drive to get your mail
Burning in my perfect life
Determined we can't fail

Sitting on the couch
Cinema all alone
Backtrack to your secret house
Parents can never know

I just wanna come over
To burn and sell the estate
I just wanna come over
And stay

When they number off the dead
I will haul the ashes there
And make certain you were one of them
And in my infant dreams of hope
You will billow up in smoke
And fill my little pink lungs

You may not find it hard
You drag my feet
You pull me to the ground
This is costing you in skin

I am sister to your tunes
Fortunate waddle while you swoon
Spanking boy is on the whipping post
His features melt into his mouth
While we're burning down the house
What a puddle of friends we have now

You may not find it hard
You drag my feet
You pull me to the ground
This is costing you in skin

You make me feel so enlightened
Like a lady found God in her purse
Lord in the store we are bringing it in
Pays in the red and it's worse

How will he take the news?
Good or bad, red or blue
Holds the victim and he folds the night
No exception to the rule
Motel 6, your check is due
Adult life is calling you

You may not find it hard
You drag my feet
You pull me to the ground
This is costing you in skin

You make me feel so enlightened
Like a lady found God in her purse

You may not find it hard
You drag my feet
You pull me to the ground
This is costing you in skin

Someone has friends on the rebound
And she is a model of you
I saw a speech last for hours
Maybe next week we'll spend in the dirt

You may not find it hard
You drag my feet
You pull me to the ground
This is costing you in skin

I dig on calculus
I shift cars with canine too
I read your diary and it leaks through
You know, you know I do

I shift on moving forms
Sway to, not back and forth
Brave soldier, tight your belt
Know the bible and your health
And it leaks through

I made cigarette burns in the center of your room
Outlined by the legs of a bug on its back
I poured salt from my palm in the center of your room
Slow and steadily built a bridge on your back

Ancient civilization
Bring me into your arms
Drain the river that feeds me
You just can't wait to meet me
I'd like to ask the host, can I please stay?
Making the most of our last days

Lean into the turn, keeping the pyramid's eye peeled
Three dark stars set in, sink, do the dead man's float
Our nine planets align, mimic linear dance moves
And we haven't got time left to choose

Ancient civilization
Bring me into your arms
Drain the river that feeds me
You just can't wait to meet me
I'd like to ask the host, can I please stay?
Making the most of our last days
Peeling the rind 'til it feels good

Crunch your numbers with pause, yield implausible 13
Punching cards for the gods so we're charged for the cost
Match the mirror's reflection and see what I see
The mirage is in charge, we'll show them who's boss

Ancient civilization
Bring me into your arms
Drain the river that feeds me
You just can't wait to meet me
I'd like to ask the host, can I please stay?
Making the most of our last days

Now you spit a heavy word
It's draining weight I pass
The halfway point, his story starts
You can't have what I have
I spoil the seed, swallow the pill
Cracking with the whip
A broken heel is on the bill

I'm gonna need your condescension
To be wide awake
Dragging my heart station to station
I'll just fade away

I spied on you behind the ghost
Now shadow grinds its jaw
A pointed run, blessed to work
Towards nothing at all
My guts in all your ashes burn
Like embers in a pipe
Take my hand, it's your turn

I'm gonna need your condescension
To be wide awake
Dragging my heart station to station
I'll just

Let me in there
Everyone is on their way, please wake up

My heart won't take it easy
A fractured pace, devoid of sense
That every time I spin its hands, it splinters
Chattering, shimmering
Crushed in the hand I held it in
So small and fragile, clear as glass, it splinters

'Cause my coin is tossed
My pain is boss
I'm wrapped in your wire

Dripping blood on the highway
Beneath the Montana sky
Cruising a course to hit the brakes, I'm under
True silence for the night
One perfect moment stuck in flight
I'm pulling out the feather and I'm under

'Cause my coin is tossed
My pain is boss
I'm wrapped in your wire

Yeah
Skeleton's wing
On a skeleton's wing

With you, I can't get by
As mothers move in private quarters
Pushed atop the ledge with the wise guys
They're searching for that stone
Stuck to the bottom
Forced to fire the torch on the fourth of July

And though it's only momentary
I have what I want
I leave our portrait fragmentary
I have what I want

I've seen you comb the queue
Illicit to drain the big blue sky
A fracture on the face of mercurial birth
A vine burst through the curb
You never wake up
No matter how much I think it's worth

And though it's only momentary
I have what I want
I leave our portrait fragmentary
I have what I want

Our stunts are regressing, we're naked and boring
Let's take it all back, I'm taking it back
Taking it back, I'm taking it
Taking it back, I'm taking it
Taking it back, I'm taking it
Taking it back, I'm taking it back

Admission is a chore
A cog inside the spinning wheel
That spits up as it turns near the earth's core
Who has the city key?
I'll never wake up
Slam my swollen fist into the door
Into the door

He came dancing across the water
With his galleons and guns
Looking for the new world
In that palace in the sun

On the shore lay Montezuma
With his coca leaves and pearls
In his halls he wondered
With the secrets of the worlds

And his subjects gathered 'round him
Like the leaves around a tree
In their clothes of many colors
For the angry gods to see

And the women all were beautiful
And the men stood straight and strong
They offered life in sacrifice
So that others could go on

Hate was just a legend
And war was never known
The people worked together
And they lifted many stones

They carried them to the flatlands
And they died along the way
But they built up with their bare hands
What we cannot build today

And I know she's living there
And she loves me to this day
I still can't remember when
Or how I lost my way

He came dancing across the water
Cortez, Cortez
What a killer

I've been long, a long way from here
Put on a poncho, played for mosquitoes
And drank 'til I was thirsty again
We went searching through thrift store jungles
Found Geronimo's rifle, Marilyn's shampoo
And Benny Goodman's corset and pen

Well, okay, I made this up
I promised you I'd never give up

If it makes you happy
It can't be that bad
If it makes you happy
Then why the hell are you so sad?

You get down, real low down
You listen to Coltrane, derail your own train
Well, who hasn't been there before?
I come round, around the hard way
Bring you comics in bed, scrape the mold off the bread
And serve you French toast again

Well, okay, I still get stoned
I'm not the kind of girl you'd take home

If it makes you happy
It can't be that bad
If it makes you happy
Then why the hell are you so sad?
If it makes you happy
It can't be that bad
If it makes you happy
Then why the hell are you so sad?

We've been far, far away from here
Put on a poncho, played for mosquitoes
And everywhere in between

Well, okay, we get along
So what if right now everything's wrong?

If it makes you happy
It can't be that bad
If it makes you happy
Then why the hell are you so sad?
If it makes you happy
It can't be that bad
If it makes you happy
Then why the hell are you so sad?

Many years we spent unpressured
That we felt so swell
Love the times of simple pleasures
Only time will tell

Oh, this is not to say
We are not the way we used to be

And we were not so fond of reason
Everyone could tell
Even times we'd start to stumble
But never ever fell

Oh, this is not to say
We were not the worst we've ever been

Fools and kings decide
Ways to live your life
This is just the way we want to be

I stay out too late
Got nothing on my brain
And that's what people say, ooh
That's what people say
I go on too many dates
But I can't make them stay
And that's what people say, ooh
That's what people say

So I keep cruising
Can't stop, won't stop moving
It's like I've got this music in my mind
Saying it's gonna be alright

'Cause the players gonna play, play, play, play, play
And the haters gonna hate, hate, hate, hate, hate
I'm just gonna shake, shake, shake, shake, shake
Shake it off
Heartbreakers gonna break, break, break, break, break
And the fakers gonna fake, fake, fake, fake, fake
I'm just gonna shake, shake, shake, shake, shake
Shake it off

I never miss a beat
I'm lightning on my feet
And that's what they don't see, ooh
That's what they don't see
I'm dancing on my own
I'll make the rules up as I go
And that's what they don't know, mmm
That's what they don't know

So I keep cruising
Can't stop, won't stop grooving
It's like I've got this music in my mind
Saying it's gonna be alright

'Cause the players gonna play, play, play, play, play
And the haters gonna hate, hate, hate, hate, hate
I'm just gonna shake, shake, shake, shake, shake
Shake it off
Heartbreakers gonna break, break, break, break, break
And the fakers gonna fake, fake, fake, fake, fake
I'm just gonna shake, shake, shake, shake, shake
Shake it off

Shake it off, shake it off
I, I shake it off, shake it off
Oh, I shake it off, shake it off
I shake it off

Hey, hey, hey
Just think when you were getting down and out
About all the liars and dirty cheats in the world
You could've been getting down to this sick beat

'Cause the players gonna play, play, play, play, play
And the haters gonna hate, hate, hate, hate, hate
I'm just gonna shake, shake, shake, shake, shake
Shake it off
Heartbreakers gonna break, break, break, break, break
And the fakers gonna fake
I'm just gonna shake
Shake it off

Shake it off, shake it off
I shake it off, shake it off
Oh, I shake it off, shake it off
I shake it off
I shake it off, shake it off
I shake it off, shake it off
Oh, I shake it off, shake it off
I shake it off

I used to be lunatic for those gracious days
I used to be woebegone and so restless nights
My aching heart would bleed for you to see
Oh, but now
(I don't find myself bouncing home
Whistling buttonhole tunes to make me cry)

No more "I love you's"
The language is leaving me
No more "I love you's"
Changes are shifting outside the word

I used to have demons in my room at night
Desire, despair, desire, so many monsters
Oh, but now
(I don't find myself bouncing home
Whistling buttonhole tunes to make me cry)

No more "I love you's"
The language is leaving me
No more "I love you's"
The language is leaving me in silence
No more "I love you's"
Changes are shifting outside the word

No more "I love you's"
The language is leaving me
No more "I love you's"
The language is leaving me in silence
No more "I love you's"
Changes are shifting outside the word

No more "I love you's"
The language is leaving me
No more "I love you's"
The language is leaving me in silence
No more "I love you's"
Changes are shifting outside the word
